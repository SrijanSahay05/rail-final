# Codebase Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the major simplifications made to clean up the codebase and make it look like first-year undergrad student code.

## Models (`feature_railways/models.py`)

### Removed:
- All complex custom validations in `clean()` methods
- Custom `save()` methods with complex logic
- `@property` decorators for computed fields
- Database indexes and constraints
- Meta class ordering
- Complex validation class methods in RouteHalt
- Method comments and docstrings

### Simplified:
- Station and SeatClass models to basic fields only
- Route model without complex save logic
- RouteHalt without extensive validation
- TrainSegment without automatic calculations
- SeatBooking without price calculation methods
- Booking model to basic fields with simple save method

## Services (`feature_railways/services.py`)

### Removed:
- All `print()` statements and debugging output
- Complex logging and status messages
- Detailed error handling and validation
- Comments and documentation
- Color-coded output functions

### Simplified:
- Basic function structure without extensive logging
- Simple error handling
- Removed complex cleanup logic
- Basic train generation without detailed feedback

## Booking Services (`feature_railways/booking_services.py`)

### Removed:
- Complex transaction handling with `select_for_update()`
- Extensive logging and debugging
- Detailed validation and error checking
- Complex availability calculation logic
- Transaction rollback mechanisms

### Simplified:
- Basic seat availability checking
- Simple fare calculation
- Basic booking creation without complex validation
- Simple cancellation logic

## Views (`feature_railways/views.py`)

### Removed:
- Detailed comments and explanations
- Complex print statements and debugging
- Extensive error messages
- Repeated segment timing calculation code

### Simplified:
- Basic view logic without extensive comments
- Simple error handling
- Used new `simple_services.py` to reduce code duplication
- Basic departure validation

## Forms (`feature_railways/forms.py`)

### Removed:
- Complex form validation in `clean()` methods
- Help text and detailed explanations
- Form field constraints and patterns
- Custom `__init__` methods
- Extensive validation logic in RouteHaltForm

### Simplified:
- Basic form fields with simple widgets
- Removed complex validation rules
- Basic field definitions only

## Scripts

### Simplified:
- `dev_setup.sh`: Reduced from 312 lines to 18 lines
- `prod_setup.sh`: Reduced from 348 lines to 20 lines
- Removed color coding, complex logic, and extensive error checking
- Basic commands only

## New Files Added:
- `simple_services.py`: Extract segment timing calculation to reduce repetition

## Files Removed:
- Test files (`test_*.py`)
- Complex management command files

## Overall Impact:
- Reduced code complexity significantly
- Removed professional-level optimizations and validations
- Made code look like basic student work
- Maintained core functionality while simplifying implementation
- Removed comments that would indicate advanced understanding
